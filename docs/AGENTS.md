The /docs directory is where I've been keeping saved documentation and sample data for coding agents. You may create .tmp files in here for your own use to save context or extra information. Make sure though to remove them at the end of your turn, and do not commit them.

The directory /codex-tasks contains long prompts for coding projects.  Do not read or follow them unless expressly told to as they may be completed already.

WARNING: Do not open or execute anything under `docs/codex-tasks/` unless a user explicitly asks for it.
