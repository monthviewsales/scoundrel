  "summary": "Short-term momentum breakout: price trading above VWAP (0.00031285) and fast EMA (0.00031520) with RSI ~66 and regime bias_up. Heavy traded volume sits below current price (high-volume nodes ~0.0003136–0.0003173); liquidity thins above current price, and token shows paid promotion (dexpaid, dexboosts) on a pump-oriented launch platform. Small marketcap (~250k–330k in window) — attractive for fast moves but high manipulation risk. Trade with tight stops or wait for pullback to VWAP/EMA for lower-risk entries.",
  "keySignals": [
    "price > VWAP (0.00031284875) and > EMA_fast (0.00031520471) — momentum up",
    "RSI 66.3 (near upper-mid) — momentum but not extreme overbought",
    "Regime: bias_up (confidence 0.57) — short-term trend bullish",
    "Volume profile concentrated at 0.00031365–0.00031729 (33% of volume) — major node below current price",
    "Low liquidity above current price (very small volume buckets above) — breakout can wick",
    "ATH 0.00086195 (ATH market cap 861,944) — historical upside exists (~2.6x from current to ATH)"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "dexpaid & dexboosts present — paid promotion / pump risk",
    "Creator == main developer wallet (centralization / single-key control)",
    "Small marketcap (~256k–332k during window) — easily moved by modest flows",
    "Thin liquidity above current price — susceptible to sharp wicks and slippage",
    "Price already near short-term high; RSI ~66 — chasing increases pullback risk",
    "Developer metadata shows 11 migrations historically — potential project instability"
  ],
  "invalidation": "Loss of bullish bias: sustained close below VWAP 0.00031285 and failure to reclaim EMA_fast 0.00031520 on rising volume (preferable invalidation = daily/1H close <0.00031285). A regime flip to bias_down or RSI dropping below ~50 also invalidates the setup.",
  "timeHorizon": "intraday to 48–72h swing (scalp-first; short swing if momentum continues)",
  "notes": "Warlord: momentum looks playable but this reeks of paid pump — if you want to live, use a tight stop at VWAP/0.00031285 or wait for a pullback to 0.000315–0.000313. Don’t get greedy; thin liquidity can turn your profit into ashes."
