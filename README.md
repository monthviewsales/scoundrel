## Requirements

- A [SolanaTracker.io](https://www.solanatracker.io/?ref=0NGJ5PPN) account (used for wallet and trade history).  
- An [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) account and the knowledge to operate its APIs.  

# Scoundrel ‚Äî a VAULT77 üîê77 relic

> *Unearthed from VAULT77, Scoundrel is a relic software tool built for trench operators.  
> It harvests and analyzes the trading patterns of top wallets, relays strategies, and keeps the link open to save our futures.*

## üì° Connect with VAULT77

- **VAULT77 Community**: [Join on X](https://x.com/i/communities/1962257350309650488)  
- **Telegram (Community)**: [@BurnWalletBroadcast](https://t.me/BurnWalletBroadcast)  
> Join VAULT77 üîê77 and become part of the operator network.

## Project Goals
Scoundrel is part of the VAULT77 üîê77 toolchain ‚Äî a research and trading side project designed to explore the use of OpenAI‚Äôs APIs and SolanaTracker data to improve memecoin trading strategies. The main goals are:

1. **Learn from Top Traders**  
   Analyze the historical on-chain trades of well-known wallets to identify styles, strategies, and patterns that consistently produce profitable results.

2. **Profile Trading Styles**  
   Build compact style profiles (e.g., momentum scalper, liquidity sniper, mean reverter) that can be recognized and applied to new trade opportunities.

3. **Integrate with Warlord Bot**  
   Use the outputs from the analysis layer as a validator module inside the bot. When the bot signals a buy, Scoundrel provides a second opinion to confirm, size, or veto the trade.

4. **Balance Speed with Explainability**  
   Keep the core signals fast and deterministic, while using OpenAI models for policy validation, risk rules, and human-readable rationale.

## Roadmap to Success

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Data Harvesting
- Select a set of famous wallets to track.
- Pull their trade history from SolanaTracker.
- For each trade, snapshot the token‚Äôs history at the time of entry and exit.
- Store enriched data locally (features, outcomes, fees, realized PnL).

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Feature Engineering & Labeling
- Engineer features at trade time: price, liquidity, spread, velocity, holders, pool age, creator flags, etc.
- Label outcomes at multiple horizons (5m, 15m, 1h, 24h).
- Normalize for all fees to ensure net PnL realism.

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Style Profiling
- Cluster wallet histories into trading styles.
- Extract descriptors (entry timing, hold duration, fee tolerance).
- Encode as JSON ‚Äúplaybooks‚Äù that can be referenced later.

### Phase 4 ‚Äî LLM Integration
- Build an OpenAI-powered validator that:
  - Compares live signals to learned profiles.
  - Runs rulebook checks (liquidity floors, dust guards, rug heuristics).
  - Produces structured JSON verdicts (proceed, reduce size, veto).
  - Logs rationale for journaling and social content.

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Bot Integration
- Connect validator into the Warlord Bot event bus.
- Run numeric signals first, then validate with Scoundrel.
- Enforce risk caps locally regardless of model output.
- Operate in shadow mode before live trading.

### Phase 6 ‚Äî Production & Iteration
- Go live with small caps and strict trailing stops.
- Evaluate results weekly against fees and benchmarks.
- Retrain style profiles as wallets evolve.
- Expand coverage to new traders and coins.

## Success Criteria
- **Consistency**: Validator adds measurable edge to raw indicator signals.
- **Resilience**: Trades respect liquidity/fee constraints and avoid dust traps.
- **Explainability**: Every trade comes with machine-readable verdict and short rationale.
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new wallets, styles, and rules over time.
